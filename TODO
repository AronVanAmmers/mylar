By Tue/Wed : multi-key search implementation: browser extension for multi-key code, server-side C++ server, mongoDB running our multi-key search, principal graph with multi-key 
Wed-Sun: multi-key proof and new implementation;

Wed: annotations
Thur - Monday : code verification based on Jonas signing module

-- what can be an acceptable idp?
-- meteor over https
-- change some of the princ graph to use symmetric keys for efficiency?
